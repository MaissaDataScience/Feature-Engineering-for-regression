# Feature-Engineering-for-regression
In this notebook, I will bring together various techniques for feature engineering that we have covered in Meduim  to tackle a regression problem. This would give you an idea of the end-to-end pipeline to build machine learning algorithms for regression.

I will:
- build a lasso
- use feature-engine for the feature engineering steps
- set up an entire engineering and prediction pipeline using a Scikit-learn Pipeline
